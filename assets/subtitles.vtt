00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.900
Thought I found a way

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.600
Thought I found a way, yeah (found)

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.700
But you never go away (never go away)

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.900
So I guess I gotta stay now

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:44.500
Oh, I hope some day I'll
make it out of here

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:52.600
Even if it takes all night
or a hundred years

00:00:52.700 --> 00:01:01.000
Need a place to hide, but
I can't find one near

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:10.300
Wanna feel alive, outside
I can fight my fear

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.900
Isn't it lovely, all alone

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.900
Tear me to pieces, skin and bone

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.300
Hello, welcome home

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.600
Walkin' out of town

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Lookin' for a better place (lookin'
for a better place)

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.200
Something's on my mind (mind)

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.800
Always in my headspace

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:55.400
But I know some day I'll
make it out of here

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:03.600
Even if it takes all night
or a hundred years

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:11.900
Need a place to hide, but
I can't find one near

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:21.400
Wanna feel alive, outside
I can fight my fear

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.900
Isn't it lovely, all alone

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.800
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.800
Tear me to pieces, skin and bone

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.300
Hello, welcome home
